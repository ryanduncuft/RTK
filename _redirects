# 1. PRIMARY CATCH-ALL REDIRECT
# This rule handles three issues at once:
#   a) Redirects the old netlify.app URL to the primary domain.
#   b) Redirects the naked domain (ryzethakidd.com) to www.
#   c) Forces HTTPS/SSL on all requests.
# It MUST be the first rule.
/* https://www.ryzethakidd.com/:splat 301!

# 2. SUCCESS PAGE REWRITE
# This rule serves the content of the success.html file
# while keeping the URL clean as /success.
/success /components/success.html 200

# 3. HTML FILE CLEANUP (Best Practice)
# This rule ensures that if someone links to /contact.html, it redirects
# them permanently to the cleaner /contact URL.
